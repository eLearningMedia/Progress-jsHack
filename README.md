In their last versions, Blackboard Learn has added drag & drop capabilities to several areas, like assignment upload o file upload. The side effect is that there is no indication to the user wether the file is uploading or not.
This small JavaScript Hack is making visible a small gif on the drag & drop area once the form is sent and the file starts uploading.

For this hack to work, you need to install the Building block JavaScript Hacks available at github: https://github.com/AllTheDucks
Then you can import the zip file and activate it.

10122020 - Changed  <hook>jsp.topFrame.start</hook> for <hook>tag.learningSystemPage.start</hook> to make it work with Ultra Base Navigation. Thank you Chris Bray (UARK) for this fix.
